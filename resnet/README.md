# Code for Pretraining ResNet

Code to reproduce results presented in the paper Controlling Neural Collapse Enhances Out-of-Distribution Detection and Transfer Learning

To use the code, simply run the following:

- To pretrain ResNet18/34 Baseline (without NC control): `pretrain_resnet.sh`

- To pretrain ResNet18/34 with NC control (Ours): `pretrain_resnet_nc.sh`

To get results for other configures, change the relevant arguments.
